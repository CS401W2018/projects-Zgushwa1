      Heading to Mongolia? Here are a few things to keep in mind that can make your trip smoother and more enjoyable — especially if it's your first time.
    </p>

    <ul class="homeinfo">
      <li><strong>Pack for different weather:</strong> The weather changes fast here. It might be warm during the day and chilly at night, even in summer. Bring layers just to be safe.</li>
      <li><strong>Be respectful around nomadic families:</strong> A lot of Mongolians still live a traditional, nomadic lifestyle. If you're visiting a ger (yurt), it's polite to accept food or drink when it's offered, even if it's just a small sip or bite.</li>
      <li><strong>Carry some cash:</strong> In the city, you can usually pay with a card. But once you're in the countryside, cash (in Mongolian Tugrik) is the way to go.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't count on strong Wi-Fi:</strong> You might not have internet access in rural areas. It helps to download maps and anything important before you head out.</li>
      <li><strong>Try the local food:</strong> Give dishes like buuz (steamed dumplings) or khuushuur (fried meat pies) a shot. Even if it's something new, it's part of the experience.</li>
      <li><strong>A local guide can really help:</strong> Especially outside the cities, a guide can help with language, directions, and understanding local customs.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn a few words:</strong> Even just saying “hello” (Sain bainuu) or “thank you” (Bayarlalaa) can go a long way and shows respect.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="homefact">
      Mongolia is home to the world's largest equestrian statue, a massive 130-foot silver monument of Genghis Khan on horseback. You can actually go inside and take an elevator up to the horse's head for an amazing view.
