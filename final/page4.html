    <h3>Mongolian Culture</h3>

    <p>
        Mongolian culture is really interesting and still influenced by its nomadic past. A lot of people still live in these round tents called gers, which are easy to move and work well in the countryside. When someone visits, even if it's random, they're usually offered milk tea and something to eat. Music is also a big part of life there, especially throat singing, which sounds totally different from anything in the West. One of the coolest things is this festival called Naadam, where there's wrestling, horse racing, and archery. Even with cities growing and things modernizing, a lot of people still hold onto their old traditions and values.

        <h3>Genghis Khan</h3>
        <p>Genghis Khan was born in Temujin around 1162, he came from a difficult childhood and then became the founder of the largest land empire in history. He united the nomadic Mongol tribes and led military campaigns across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. He was known for his brutal conquests, but he also promoted religious freedom, trade, and legal reforms. His descendants expanded the empire even further after his death in 1227. Nobody knows exactly where he was buried.</p>
