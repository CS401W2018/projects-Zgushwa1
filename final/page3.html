    <h3>Traditional Mongolian Cuisine</h3>

    <p>
      Food in Mongolia reflects the rhythm of everyday life, especially for families who raise livestock and move with the seasons. Meals are made around what's available and what will keep them full and energized. Meat and dairy are mostly found in every dish. In the cold winter months, people often eat hearty meals like boiled mutton to stay warm as it gets -40°C. When summer comes around and the animals produce more milk, their diet will move toward dairy. This season is referred to as “white months”, when foods like yogurt, cheese, butter, and fermented mare's milk, known as airag, are eaten more regularly.
