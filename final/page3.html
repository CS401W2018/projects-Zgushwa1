    <h3>Traditional Mongolian Cuisine</h3>

    <p>
      Food in Mongolia reflects the rhythm of everyday life, especially for families who raise livestock and move with the seasons. Meals are made around what's available and what will keep them full and energized. Meat and dairy are mostly found in every dish. In the cold winter months, people often eat hearty meals like boiled mutton to stay warm as it gets -40 C in the winter. When summer comes around and the animals produce more milk, their diet will move toward dairy. This season is referred to as “white months”, when foods like yogurt, cheese, butter, and fermented mare's milk, known as airag, are eaten more regularly.

    <h3>Other Traditional Dishes You Should Know</h3>

    <p>
      Instead of Buuz and Khuushuur, Mongolian food has a lot of other famous dishes that fit the way the people live there. Tsuivan is basically stir-fried noodles with meat and vegetables. The noodles are usually made from scratch, and are very delicious. Another unique food they have is  Boodog, where they cook goat or marmot by placing hot stones inside the animal. It is usually made for bigger holidays.

      People from Mongolia also drink Suutei Tsai, which is like salty milk tea. It's made with milk, water, and sometimes butter. It might sound strange at first, but it's pretty common and usually served with things like Aaruul. It's a sour, dried cheese snack that's really good for you. These foods aren't just about eating, they're a big part of how people welcome guests and spend time together.
