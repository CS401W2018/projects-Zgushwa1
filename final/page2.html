        <h3>Gobi Desert</h3>
        <p>The Gobi Desert is one of the largest deserts in all of Asia, known for massive sand dunes, cliffs, camel rides, and dinosaur fossils. Visitors can explore the land and sleep under the stars in traditional gers. The desert is also home to wildlife like wild Bactrian camels and snow leopards. Despite its harsh environment, the Gobi holds deep historical and spiritual importance for Mongolians.</p>

      <h3>Why Visit These Places?</h3>
      <div class="info">
        <p>Mongolia isn't just a place to see sights—it's where things still move at their own pace. Stay in a ger, look up at the stars, or sit by Lake Khövsgöl in silence, and feel the calm settle in.</p>
        <p>Most of the country still feels untouched, which adds to its charm. The people are genuinely welcoming, and the experiences—like wild horses or sipping salty milk tea in a mountain lodge—are real, not staged.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for quiet and authenticity, Mongolia has a way of staying with you. Each place has its own pace and personality that shows the country hasn't lost touch with its roots.</p>
