        <h3>Gobi Desert</h3>
        <p>
            The Gobi Desert is one of the largest deserts in all of Asia, it's known for massive sand dunes, cliffs, camel rides, and dinosaur fossils. Visitors can come and explore the land and sleep under the stars in traditional gers. The desert is also home to wildlife like wild Bactrian camels and snow leopards. Despite its harsh environment, the Gobi holds deep historical and spiritual importance for Mongolians.

      <h3>Why Visit These Places?</h3>
      <div class="extra">
        <p>
          Mongolia isn't just a place you go to see a few sights. It's one of those rare destinations where things still move at their own pace. When you stay in a ger and look up at the stars, or just sit by the edge of Lake Khövsgöl taking in the silence, there's a calm that settles in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the country still feels untouched, which is part of the charm. The people are welcoming in a way that doesn't feel staged. You might find yourself watching wild horses without another person in sight, or drinking salty milk tea in a quiet lodge somewhere in the mountains. These aren't tourist showpieces, they're just real parts of life here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're after something a bit quieter and more grounded, Mongolia has a way of staying with you. Every place you visit has its own pace and personality, and together they paint a picture of a country that hasn't lost touch with its roots.
