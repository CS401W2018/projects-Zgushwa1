            <p>Why is the viewport meta tag important?</p>
            <p>It is important because it makes it where the page is able to be seen from different types of devices.</p>
            <p>How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
            <p>You would copy and paste the css into another css and rename it for printing. You would attach it to your html file and make corrections only on the css file for printing</p>
            <p>When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
            <p>You would want to adjust the css for printing when you want to make sure that the page is able to be printed out and look good on paper.</p>
            <p>When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?
                <p>The one that was listed last will be the one that will take priority.</p>
                <p>How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</p>
                <p>You would change the css for a web page displayed on a phone by using the media screen tag and changing the css for the phone.</p>
