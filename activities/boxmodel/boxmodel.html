        <p>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</p>
        <p>Block tags cause a line break and form a box and want the width to be as wide as possible. Inline tags will take up as much width as possible and have no line break. You cant adjust the size of them. </p>
        <p>What is the margin, border, and padding?</p>
        <p>Margin is the space outside the border. Border is the border around the padding. Padding is the space inside the border.</p>
        <p>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS</p>
        <p>The different kinds of measurements are pixels, inches, centimeters all fixed.
            Relative measurements are percentage, em, and rem.
