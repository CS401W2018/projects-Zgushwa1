    <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, going to the beach, and learning new things. I have one dog that I had to leave on the mainland. I have lived in Hawaii for 2 years now.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed taking my dog to the dog park and playing with him daily. In the meantime, I expeirment with new recipes and try to make new things every day. I find that the beaches here may be the best in the world. I enjoy spending time with my wife and trying new activities with her</p>
    <p>My favorite beaches include</p>
    <ol>A. <em>Sunset Beach</em></ol>
    <ol>B. <mark>Lanikai Beach</mark></ol>
    <ol>C. <strong>Hauula Beach Park &pound;</strong></ol>
