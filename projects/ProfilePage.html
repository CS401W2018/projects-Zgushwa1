    <h1>Zackary Gushwa</h1>
    <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, going to the beach, and learning new things. I have one dog that I had to leave on the mainland. I have lived in Hawaii for 2 years now.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed taking my dog to the dog park and playing with him daily. In the meantime, I experiment with new recipes and try to make new things every day. I find that the beaches here may be the best in the world. I enjoy spending time with my wife and trying new activities with her.</p>
    <p>My favorite beaches include:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li><em>Sunset Beach</em></li>
        <li><mark>Lanikai Beach</mark></li>
        <li><strong>Hauula Beach Park &pound;</strong></li>
    </ol>
