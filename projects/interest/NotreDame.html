        <h1>Notre Dame Football</h1>
        <p>I am highly intertested in Notre Dame Football. My family lives close by the stadium and I grew up watching them. When I was younger I always dreamed of playing football at the school. In high school I played all 4 years of football.</p>
        <h2>National Championship</h2>
        <p>This year Notre Dame was able to make it to the National Championship game agasinst Ohio State. It was a great game with Notre Dame putting a great effort to win. They came up short and not winning, but they made it really far. It was the first 12 team playoff in the NCAA history. They beat teams that includes Penn State and Georgia to make it there. </p>
