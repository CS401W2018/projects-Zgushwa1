        <p>I am highly interested in <span>Notre Dame Football</span>. My family lives close by the stadium and I grew up watching them. When I was younger I always dreamed of playing football at the school. In high school, I played all 4 years of football.</p>
        <h2>National Championship</h2>
        <p>This year <span>Notre Dame</span> was able to make it to the National Championship game against Ohio State. It was a great game with Notre Dame putting a great effort to win. They came up short and did not win, but they made it really far. It was the first 12-team playoff in NCAA history. They beat teams that included Penn State and Georgia to make it there.</p>
